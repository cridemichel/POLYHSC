abstract = {Colloidal particles, which consist of clusters of hundreds or thousands of atoms, can still resemble atomic systems. In particular, colloids have been used to study the packing of spheres and the influence of short-range interactions on crystallization and melting. Manoharan reviews these similarities, as well as the cases in which colloidal particles show behavior not seen in atomic systems. For example, the packing of nonspherical objects, where geometry or topology may matter, can give insights into the role of entropy in packing. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1253751 Colloidal particles with well-controlled shapes and interactions are an ideal experimental system for exploring how matter organizes itself. Like atoms and molecules, these particles form bulk phases such as liquids and crystals. But they are more than just crude analogs of atoms; they are a form of matter in their own right, with complex and interesting collective behavior not seen at the atomic scale. Their behavior is affected by geometrical or topological constraints, such as curved surfaces or the shapes of the particles. Because the interactions between the particles are often short-ranged, we can understand the effects of these constraints using geometrical concepts such as packing. The geometrical viewpoint gives us a window into how entropy affects not only the structure of matter, but also the dynamics of how it forms.}}

To this end{,} we review synthetic methodologies developed to impart colloidal building blocks with anisotropic shapes and self-assembly mechanisms that exploit geometry to direct and control the particles{'} organization. This paper{,} which deliberately focuses on micron-scale colloids{,} is divided into two main sections. Firstly{,} we discuss the impact of shape on particles{'} interactions and how this has been exploited to develop heuristic rules for the creation of self-assembling architectures. Secondly{,} we examine state-of-the-art advances in colloidal synthesis with a clear emphasis on design rules and bulk methods{,} which are aimed at producing shape-anisotropic particles."}

abstract="Atoms serve as an inspiration for colloidal self-assembly, whereby building blocks can combine and confer endless functionality using a few design principles, including directionality, valence and reversible binding. Tetrahedral structures inspired by the bonding of carbon atoms have long been targeted as candidates for metamaterials and are now becoming accessible through molecular mimetic colloidal building blocks. Beyond carbon mimics, increasingly complex particles are being synthesized that can be arranged in their own periodic table and used to generate forms of matter unique to colloidal systems. This Review presents a framework to describe the synthesis of these micrometre-scale colloids, in which the fundamental constituents are either combined through interparticle reactions or transformed through intraparticle reactions, in analogy to molecules in traditional synthetic chemistry. We build on this framework to illustrate how unique particle shape and surface chemistry leads to diverse assembly routes for these colloidal building blocks.",

abstract="A revolution in novel nanoparticles and colloidal building blocks has been enabled by recent breakthroughs in particle synthesis. These new particles are poised to become the `atoms' and `molecules' of tomorrow's materials if they can be successfully assembled into useful structures. Here, we discuss the recent progress made in the synthesis of nanocrystals and colloidal particles and draw analogies between these new particulate building blocks and better-studied molecules and supramolecular objects. We argue for a conceptual framework for these new building blocks based on anisotropy attributes and discuss the prognosis for future progress in exploiting anisotropy for materials design and assembly.",

abstract="Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and plays crucial roles in biology, medicine, physics and materials science. Understanding and controlling chirality is therefore an important research challenge with broad implications. Unlike other chiral colloids, such as nanocellulose or filamentous viruses, amyloid fibrils form nematic phases but appear to miss their twisted form, the cholesteric or chiral nematic phases, despite a well-defined chirality at the single fibril level. Here we report the discovery of cholesteric phases in amyloids, using $\beta$-lactoglobulin fibrils shortened by shear stresses. The physical behaviour of these new cholesteric materials exhibits unprecedented structural complexity, with confinement-driven ordering transitions between at least three types of nematic and cholesteric tactoids. We use energy functional theory to rationalize these results and observe a chirality inversion from the left-handed amyloids to right-handed cholesteric droplets. These findings deepen our understanding of cholesteric phases, advancing their use in soft nanotechnology, nanomaterial templating and self-assembly.",
